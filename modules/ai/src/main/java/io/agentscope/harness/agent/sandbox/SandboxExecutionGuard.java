/**
 * Pluggable concurrency guard for sandbox execution slots.
 *
 * <p>A guard controls how many concurrent executions are allowed for a given
 * {@link SandboxIsolationKey}. The default {@link #noop()} imposes no restriction, preserving
 * existing behaviour.
 *
 * <p>This extension point is primarily useful for {@link IsolationScope#USER},
 * {@link IsolationScope#AGENT} and {@link IsolationScope#GLOBAL} scopes, where multiple
 * concurrent callers could otherwise race on the same persistent state slot (last write wins).
 * Providing a guard serialises such callers without requiring changes to the surrounding
 * infrastructure.
 *
 * <p>Implementations may use any backend — JVM semaphores, Redis {@code SET NX} leases,
 * ZooKeeper, database advisory locks, etc. — and must be thread-safe.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SandboxExecutionGuard guard = key -> {
 *     redisClient.set(key.toString(), token, SetArgs.Builder.nx().px(30_000));
 *     return () -> redisClient.eval(LUA_RELEASE_SCRIPT, key.toString(), token);
 * };
 *
 * HarnessAgent.builder()
 *     .filesystem(new DockerFilesystemSpec()
 *         .isolationScope(IsolationScope.AGENT)
 *         .executionGuard(guard))
 *     ...
 *     .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>The harness calls {@link #tryEnter} before sandbox acquire/resume and closes the returned
 * {@link SandboxLease} after {@link SandboxManager#release} completes, so the guard covers the
 * full call window: {@code acquire → start → (call) → stop → release → lease.close()}.
 */

     * <p>The returned {@link SandboxLease} must be closed to release the slot. The harness handles
     * this automatically; callers do not need to close the lease explicitly.
