# FunASR Runtime Roadmap
中文文档（[点击此处](./readme_cn.md)）

FunASR is a speech recognition framework developed by the Speech Lab of DAMO Academy, which integrates industrial-level models in the fields of speech endpoint detection, speech recognition, punctuation segmentation, and more. 
It has attracted many developers to participate in experiencing and developing. To solve the last mile of industrial landing and integrate models into business, we have developed the FunASR runtime-SDK. The SDK supports several service deployments, including:

- File transcription service, Mandarin, CPU version, done
- The real-time transcription service, Mandarin (CPU), done
- File transcription service, English, CPU version, done
- File transcription service, Mandarin, GPU version, done
- and more.

## File Transcription Service, Mandarin (GPU)

Currently, the FunASR runtime-SDK supports the deployment of file transcription service, Mandarin (GPU version), with a complete speech recognition chain that can transcribe tens of hours of audio into punctuated text, and supports recognition for more than a hundred concurrent streams. 

To meet the needs of different users, we have prepared different tutorials with text and images for both novice and advanced developers.

### Whats-new
- 2024/09/26: File Transcription Service 2.0 GPU released, Fix GPU memory leak, docker image version funasr-runtime-sdk-gpu-0.2.0 (d280bf7e495b)
