 * Interface for observers wanting to be notified of incoming FreeSWITCH Event Socket events.

 * events are received off the wire.
 * <p/>
 * This design ensures that incoming event processing is not blocked by any long-running listener process.
 * However multiple listeners will be notified sequentially, and so one slow listener can cause latency
 * to other listeners.
