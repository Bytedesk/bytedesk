//== Errors
//
//Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
//that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:
//
//include::{snippets}/hello/http-request.adoc[]
//
//For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a note will produce a
//`400 Bad Request` response:
//
//include::{snippets}/hello/http-response.adoc[]
