Validate host certificates against public keys of pinned certificates.

`MQTTSSLPinningModeCertificate`
Validate host certificates against pinned certificates.

/**
`MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy` evaluates server trust against pinned X.509 certificates and public keys over secure connections.
 
If your app using security model which require pinning SSL certificates to helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
and other vulnerabilities. you need to set securityPolicy to properly value(see MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy.h for more detail).

NOTE: about self-signed server certificates:
if your server using Self-signed certificates to establish SSL/TLS connection, you need to set property:
MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy.allowInvalidCertificates=YES.

If SSL is enabled, by default it only evaluate server's certificates using CA infrastructure, and for most case, this type of check is enough.
However, if your app using security model which require pinning SSL certificates to helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
and other vulnerabilities. you may need to set securityPolicy to properly value(see MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy.h for more detail).

NOTE: about self-signed server certificates:
In CA infrastructure, you may establish a SSL/TLS connection with server which using self-signed certificates
by install the certificates into OS keychain(either programmatically or manually). however, this method has some disadvantages:
1. every socket you app created will trust certificates you added.
2. if user choice to remove certificates from keychain, you app need to handling certificates re-adding.

If you only want to verify the cert for the socket you are creating and for no other sockets in your app, you need to use
MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy.
And if you use self-signed server certificates, your need to set property: MQTTSSLSecurityPolicy.allowInvalidCertificates=YES

Adding pinned SSL certificates to your app helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities.
Applications dealing with sensitive customer data or financial information are strongly encouraged to route all communication
over an SSL/TLS connection with SSL pinning configured and enabled.
